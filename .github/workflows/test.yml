    # 03/27/23: it looks like there are issues with the tarballs for all python 3.6 versions
    # that are on ubuntu-22.04 (ubuntu-latest at the time). To maintain python compatibility
    # we're pinning ubuntu-20.04 so that we can properly run install python 3.6.
    #
    # As soon as this issue is addressed, we should put the image back to ubuntu-latest:
